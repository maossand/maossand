## Hi there! 🙋 I'm Martin, Data Analyst based in Paris 🇫🇷
I might have watched a bit too much Scooby-Doo as a kid, and somewhere along the way, the thrill of solving mysteries seems to have stayed with me. I like to think of data analytics as another form of detective work. So here I am, on a quest to unravel the mysteries hidden within datasets. When I’m not decoding trends or visualizing insights, you can find me in the kitchen🧑‍🍳, staying active🏋️ or jamming to my favorite tunes🧑‍🎤. Let’s dive into the world of data together and unmask the insights waiting to be discovered!
